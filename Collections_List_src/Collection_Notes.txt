		built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

		namedtuple()	factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
		deque			list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
		ChainMap		dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings
		Counter	dict 	subclass for counting hashable objects
		OrderedDict		dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
		defaultdict		dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
		UserDict		wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing
		UserList		wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
		UserString		wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing
